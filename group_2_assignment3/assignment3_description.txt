	This submission consists of three programs: extract_words.pde, a3_novelvisualization.pde, and a3_wordfrequency.pde.

Aidan O'Keeffe: extract_words.pde:
	This program intakes the novel "Heart of Darkness" as a text document and produces the text documents
"allwords.txt", "uniquewords.txt", and "wordfrequency.txt" per the assignment specifications. The code for writing each
file are all separated into their own functions, and the function creating wordfrequency.txt makes heavy use of hashmaps
and sets to perform its task.
	Please note that, although the assignment specifies that extract_words be a Python script, Professor Abraham 
clarified in a comment after class that using Processing was acceptable, although more cumbersone. That is was.
