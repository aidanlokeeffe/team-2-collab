This is an extension of the submission for assignment 7, a tactical game called "Noble Souls". This is a two player game. 
The goal is to eliminate all of your opponent's units.

I) The rules of play are:
(1) On a player's turn, they may select one unit, and move them to an available tile. A
tile is available if it is not water, it is not occupied, and it is within the 
units movement range.
(2) If an enemy is within a unit's attack range, it may be attacked.
(3) A player may end their turn without moving, with moving but without attacking,
vice versa, or with moving and with attacking.
(4) Each unit can attack once per turn.
(5) If a unit's health drops to zero, then the unit is eliminated.
(6) When you have eliminated all of your opponent's units, you win. This is the 
end game condition.

II) The user inputs are:
(1) The start button.
(2) Keys 1, 2, and 3 for level selection.
(3) A unit may be selected with the mouse.
(4) A unit may be moved with the mouse.
(5) A player may select an enemy unit adjacent to their unit to attack via the gui on the right-hand side of the screen.
(6) A player ends their turn by clicking the end turn button.
(7) Either player may mute or unmute the sound using the button on the GUI.
(8) A highlighted cursor follows the unit's mouse along the map.

The title screen constitutes GUI 1, the level select GUI 2, and the gameplay and sidebar GUIs 3 and 4, respectively.

III) Data Output:
To the text file "previousGameData", the game (1) thanks the players for choosing Noble Souls, (2) records the chosen 
level, and (3) records each players moves by which tile was left and which tile was entered on a numbered round-by-round 
basis, where a round is defined one set of turns taken by blue, then red.

III) Member Contributions:
Russell Dickerson: Russell was responsible for the units themselves, for creating the art, 
for composing the music, and for implementing attacking for units and the combat forecast interface.
Methods that Russell wrote include: (1) all display and constructor methods under unit classes, 
(2) overButton, isMuted, update, and display methods in the Music class, (3) checkForEnemies, displayCombat,
displayAttackButton, overAttackButton, combatForecast, attack, die, and the constructor for the Unit Class.
Methods Russell helped out with were availableTiles in the Graph class, and the update and overtile in the 
Node class. Additionally, Russell created the music for the game, and made all of the sprites and their
animations, including the tile sprites for the map. 
	Russell also animated and coded a large number of additional units including wizards, clerics, and lumberjacks. 
He created the title screen, and also implemented hierarchical animations on the title screen. He also created the art assets 
for the level select screen. He fixed bugs related to combat as well.

Angelo Gomez: Angelo was mostly responsible for implementing the UI seen on the right side of the board.
He created the end turn button, the ability to see a units stats, and designed the colors of the interface.
Additionally, Angelo worked on board by having tiles that highlight as you mouse over them and created the function
that allows you to select a function and see the data of unit sitting on there. 
	Angelo initiated the transfer of old code to the new program file. Angelo also did a lot of work to simplify the 
UI code. He spotted and fixed other bugs throughout the code as well. Finally, Angelo programmed the data output.

Aidan O'Keeffe: Aidan was broadly responsible for implementing the board. 
Particular methods which Aidan either wrote or to which he was a contributor 
include: (1) under Graph: constructor, setNodes, setEdges, addEdge, 
hasVertex, getAdjacentUnvisitedVertex, getIndex, and availableTiles, (2) under
Node: constructor, was visited, isOccupied, getLabel, getCoords, and display,
(3) under Unit: constructor and Move, and (4) under Player, constructor and
display.
	Aidan modidified the availableTiles method to use breadth-first search
instead of depth-first search, which cleared bugs related to this method. He also
created the new maps and programmed the level select.
