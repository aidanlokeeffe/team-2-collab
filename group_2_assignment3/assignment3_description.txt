	This submission consists of three programs: extract_words.pde, a3_novelvisualization.pde, and a3_wordfrequency.pde.

Aidan O'Keeffe: extract_words.pde:
	This program intakes the novel "Heart of Darkness" as a text document and produces the text documents
	"allwords.txt", "uniquewords.txt", and "wordfrequency.txt" per the assignment specifications. The code for writing each
	file are all separated into their own functions, and the function creating wordfrequency.txt makes heavy use of hashmaps
	and sets to perform its task.
Please note that, although the assignment specifies that extract_words be a Python script, Professor Abraham 
	clarified in a comment after class that using Processing was acceptable, although more cumbersone. That is was.

Russell Dickerson: a3_novelvisualization.pde:
	This program takes the text file "uniquewords.txt" and creates a visualiztion on the canvas of random words from the file.
	It randomly selects colors for each word and will update the word visualization with a new set of random words from
	"uniquewords.txt" when the user clicks the canvas. The colors chosen for the words were green, light blue and yellow because the
	takes place on a river in a jungle. There are several functions in the file that take care of writing the words to the
	canvas including one that shuffles the string array, and another that writes the text to the canvas. The shuffle function was made
	based on the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm which I referenced wikipedia for to learn how to code it.
