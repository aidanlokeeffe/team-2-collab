Progress Report 6.1
	We will be using cellular automata to simulate the reaction
	NH3 (g) + HCl (g) --> NH4Cl (s)
on the canvas. 
	
	Aidan is the lead regarding the math involved, and regarding assigning initial velocities to the gas particles 
as they are spawned in by the user. This thus entails user input.
	Russel is the lead for implementing the collision rules for the automate. For the following, the name of a 
compound refers to a single moluecule of that compound:
	(1) NH3 always collides perfectly elastically with NH3
	(2) HCl always collides perfectly elastically with HCl
	(3) If NH3 collides with HCl, but their velocities fail to meet some "reaction criterion" yet TBD, then they 
	collide perfectly elastically
	(4) If NH3 collides with HCl and their velocities meet the "reaction criterion", they they react to form a molecule
	of NH4Cl
	(5) NH4Cl is subject to gravity and falls through the bottom of the screen
	(6) If NH3 or HCl collide with NH4Cl, they they are deflected perfectly elastically
	Angelo is the support on both of the above.

	The team will confer periodically during the week to keep an eye on progress and address hurdles.
