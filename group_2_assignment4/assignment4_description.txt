The animation shown is meant to be a golden plate leaving a furnace and proceeding 
to be smashed by mechanical hammers in a factory. 

The classes in cluded in the project are the following:

conveyorBelt - the conveyor belt class, created by Angelo Gomez, displays the constantly moving image of the conveyor belt.
	This image creates the illusion of motion by having the circles, or "rotors," of the belt constantly spinning while
	the lines, or "treads," of the belt move along with it in order to give the appearance of rightward motion to the
	shape.

engine - 

Hammer - 

plate - the plate class, created by Angelo Gomez, is a simple rectangular shape that constantly moves across the screen.
	It initially appears behind the engine and slides slowly across the screen, emerging from the engine and over the
	belt. Once it completely moves off screen the bar will reappear behind the engine and repeat.

Unexpected Challenges:
Angelo - "I came across no real challenges in my part though I did struggle with how to give the belt the illusion of movement
	  because I did not know how to create a proper rotation movement with the vectors of the belt."
