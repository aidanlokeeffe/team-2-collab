This is a tactical game called "Noble Souls". This is a two player game. The goal
is to eliminate all of your opponent's units.

I) The rules of play are:
(1) On a player's turn, they may select one unit, and move them to an available. A
tile is available if it is not water, it is not occupied, and it is within the 
units movement range.*
(2) If an enemy is within a unit's attack range, it may be attacked.
(3) A player may end their turn without moving, with moving but without attacking,
vice versa, or with moving and with attacking.
(4) If a unit's health drops to zero, then the unit is eliminated.
(5) When you have eliminated all of your opponent's units, you win. This is the 
end game condition.

II) The user inputs are:
(1) A unit may be selected with the mouse.
(2) A unit may be moved with the mouse.
(3) A player may select an enemy unit to attack with the mouse.
(4) A player ends their turn by clicking the end turn button.
(5) Either player may mute or unmute the sound.

Aidan O'Keeffe: Aidan was broadly responsible for implementing the board. 
Particular methods which Aidan either wrote or to which he was a contributor 
include: (1) under Graph: constructor, setNodes, setEdges, addEdge, 
hasVertex, getAdjacentUnvisitedVertex, getIndex, and availableTiles, (2) under
Node: constructor, was visited, isOccupied, getLabel, getCoords, and display,
(3) under Unit: constructor and Move, and (4) under Player, constructor and
display.

IV) Extensions and Improvements:
(1) The availableTiles method is inherently flawed in its use of depth-first
search rather than breadth-first search. There is also some difficult in finding
the widest possible range of tiles due to the large number of cycles in the 
board graph. A major imporvement would be to change the algorithm used in 
availableTiles.
*(2) There is a bug where selecting the tile immediately above a previously 
selected tile does not deselect the previous tile. This causes difficulty in
moving units, as to move them into a tile directly above them, the player has to
first click a tile to the left or right of the tile immediately above the 
previously selected tile, and then slide the pointer over the target tile.
(3) The emphasize that units can jump over each other, they should trace out an
arc between their current tile and the target tile. 
(4) The game would benefit from a title screen, a pause screen, and more maps.
