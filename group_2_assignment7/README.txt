Once the game is loaded, you can select a unit by clicking on it.
The music can be toggled on/off with the mute button on the UI.
Once a unit is clicked on, the user interface will display information about that unit.
Selecting a tile within the unit's highlighted movement range will allow it to move to a new tile.
When a unit is adjacent to an enemy unit, a combat interface will appear on the UI.
The number shown displays how much damage the unit will do.
To attack, click the attack button on the UI.
A unit may only attack once per turn.
After you are done moving and attacking units, hit the end turn button to let the other player play.
The winner is the player that takes out all of the opposing players units.
